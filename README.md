# koa_vue
a simple demo with koa2 and vue.u can find complete front-end,back-end and sql.
# koa2
use the dir(common) to finish your web server quickly.as for how to use it,u can understand after reading the router.js and user.js.
just build the CURD quickly and focus on harder bussiness  
To drive the back-end, you just need 'npm i',then 'node index.js'
# 后端甩锅福利
  -'诶诶，这个接口怎么报错啊，我参数传的不对吗，有没有接口文档'  
  -'文档没有，要命一条，自己对着数据库调参去'
# vue
it's not the focus,but it's also a small and delicate website with iview and axios.u can understand how i design this app to use the api from koa2  
To driver the app,just 'npm i', then 'npm run dev'
# sql
mysql is the best choose to write a demo and build projects,it's small and easily to use.
